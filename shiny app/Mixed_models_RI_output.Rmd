## effect plot
# in cases were we consider statistical models with complex terms (interactions and nonlinear terms), the regression coefficients 
# we obtain in the output do not have a straightforward interpretation. In these settings, we can use effect plots to communicate
# the results of the model. The first step is to specify a dataset that contains combinations of values for the covariates of the
# model based on which we will create the plot. In our example, we can create a single figure for each drug group and increasing time

  obstime = seq(min(aids$obstime, na.rm = T), max(aids$obstime, na.rm = T), length.out = 80),
  drug = gl(2, 80)
))

# with the previous code, we will create the plot for increasing time from min time to max time and both drug and placebo. 
# Next, we obtain the predictions from the model, and we calculate the 95% confidence interval
