## fit a linear mixed effects model
lmeFit <- lme(CD4 ~ obstime + obstime:drug,

## fit a survival model

## effect plot
# in cases were we consider statistical models with complex terms (interactions and nonlinear terms), the regression coefficients we obtain in the output do not have a straightforward interpretation. In these settings, we can use effect plots to communicate the results of the model. The first step is to specify a dataset that contains combinations of values for the covariates of the model based on which we will create the plot. In our example, we can create a single figure for each drug group and increasing CD4
newdata <- with(aids, data.frame(
  CD4 = seq(min(aids$CD4, na.rm = T), max(aids$CD4, na.rm = T), length.out = 80),
  drug = gl(2, 80),
  gender = rep(1,80)
))

# with the previous code we will create the plot for increasing CD4 from min CD4 to max CD4, females, and both drug and placebo. Next, we obtain the predictions from the model (these are in the log-hazard scale), and we calculate the 95% confidence interval
X <- model.matrix(~ drug + gender + CD4, data = newdata)

betas <- fixef(jointFit, "Event")
Vbetas <- vcov(jointFit, "Event")[c("drugddI", "gendermale", "Assoct"), c("drugddI", "gendermale", "Assoct")]
newdata$pred <- c(X[,-1] %*% betas)
se.pred <- sqrt(diag(X[,-1] %*% Vbetas %*% t(X[,-1])))
newdata$lo <- newdata$pred - 1.96 * se.pred
newdata$up <- newdata$pred + 1.96 * se.pred

newdata$drug <- factor(newdata$drug, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("ddC", "ddI"))

# the last line of the code transforms the drug variable to a factor in order to have a more visible label in the plot that is produced with the following code
xyplot(pred + lo + up ~ CD4 | drug, type = "l", lty = c(1, 2, 2), 
       par.settings = list(fontsize = list(text = 15, points = 20)),
       data = newdata, col = 1, lwd = 2, ylab = "log Hazard Ratio", xlab = "CD4",
       main = "", as.table = TRUE
